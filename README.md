# Game-of-Thrones-Character-Matching-Engine-Project
The objective of a "Game of Thrones Character Matching Engine" is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately 
match characters in the Game of Thrones TV show based on their similarities.
This model could create new and innovative ways to interact with the show's content.
The  model Recommend similar characters to viewers The engine could be used to recommend similar characters to viewers based on their favorite characters,
or based on their interests in the show. For example, if a viewer likes Daenerys Targaryen, the engine could recommend other characters such as Jon Snow,
Tyrion Lannister, or Arya Stark. A Game of Thrones Character Matching Engine could be a valuable tool for both
fans of the show and for researchers interested in machine learning and natural language processing.
